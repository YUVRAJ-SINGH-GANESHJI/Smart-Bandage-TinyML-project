# ML Models Comparison Results Summary

The comparison script is currently running and will generate a comprehensive comparison of four different machine learning models for wound classification:

1. **Random Forest** (current model)
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (implemented as a simple neural network)

## Expected Results

When the script completes, you'll find the following files in the `ml_models_comparison/results` directory:

### Visualization Files
- `model_comparison.png` - A set of bar charts comparing all models on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and inference time
- `confusion_matrix_Random Forest.png` - Confusion matrix for the Random Forest model
- `confusion_matrix_Logistic Regression.png` - Confusion matrix for the Logistic Regression model
- `confusion_matrix_SVM.png` - Confusion matrix for the SVM model
- `confusion_matrix_CNN.png` - Confusion matrix for the CNN model
- `cnn_training_history.png` - Training and validation accuracy curves for the CNN model

### Results Files
- `model_comparison_results.json` - Detailed metrics in JSON format for programmatic access
- `model_comparison_summary.txt` - Human-readable summary of all model performance metrics

## Anticipated Outcomes

Based on our understanding of the data and models:

1. **Random Forest** will likely show the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall, consistent with its current use in the project.

2. **Logistic Regression** will probably have the fastest training and inference times but lower accuracy, as it may struggle with the non-linear relationships in the wound data.

3. **SVM** is expected to perform well on this dataset, potentially approaching Random Forest in accuracy, but with higher computational cost.

4. **CNN** might achieve high accuracy but will likely have the longest training time and may show signs of overfitting on this relatively small dataset.

## How to Interpret Results

When reviewing the results, consider:

1. **Accuracy trade-offs**: Is a small improvement in accuracy (e.g., 1-2%) worth the increased complexity or computational cost?

2. **Inference time**: For real-time applications in a smart bandage, inference time is critical. Models with lower inference times are preferable.

3. **Confusion matrices**: Look for which models handle specific wound conditions better. Some models might excel at detecting infections but struggle with healing wounds.

4. **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: The summary will show the best hyperparameters for each model, indicating how sensitive each model is to tuning.

## Next Steps

After reviewing the results:

1. If Random Forest is confirmed as the best model, you can confidently continue using it as the primary classifier.

2. If another model shows significant advantages, consider integrating it into the main system.

3. The detailed performance metrics will help inform where future improvements should focus - whether on data quality, feature engineering, or model architecture.
