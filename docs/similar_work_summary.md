## Unique Aspects of Our Approach

1. **Comprehensive Parameter Set**: Our inclusion of oxygen saturation is unique among the reviewed systems
2. **Random Forest Performance**: Our model achieved higher accuracy (97.5%) than comparable approaches, though with synthetic data
3. **Feature Importance Analysis**: We found different feature importance patterns than Mehmood et al., with exudate level showing higher significance in our model
4. **Interactive Simulation**: Our GUI-based simulation allows for real-time exploration of parameter relationships, which is not present in other systems
5. **Parameter Contribution Visualization**: The feature contribution visualization in our GUI provides insights into how each parameter affects classification

## Future Research Directions

Based on the literature review, promising future directions include:

1. **Integration of Additional Biomarkers**: Including CRP, bacterial metabolites, or immune markers
2. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Analyzing the change in parameters over time rather than single measurements
3. **Patient-Specific Calibration**: Developing methods to customize models for individual patients
4. **Hybrid Models**: Combining rule-based clinical knowledge with ML approaches
5. **Validation with Real Data**: The critical next step for all synthetic data approaches

## Conclusion

The field of ML-based smart bandages is rapidly evolving, with approaches ranging from simple rule-based systems to complex multi-parameter machine learning models. Our approach compares favorably with existing research in terms of comprehensiveness and classification performance, though validation with real patient data remains a necessary future step.

The most similar work (Mehmood et al., 2022) used a comparable classification approach but with different parameter importance findings, suggesting that further research on parameter selection and weighting is needed to develop optimal models for clinical application.
