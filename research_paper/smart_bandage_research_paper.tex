\begin{abstract}
Chronic wounds and battlefield injuries require continuous monitoring to detect infection and track healing progression. Traditional wound assessment methods are subjective, intermittent, and often require removing dressings, which can disrupt the healing process and increase infection risk. This paper introduces a novel smart bandage system utilizing TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) to enable continuous, non-invasive wound monitoring. The system uses miniaturized sensors to collect key physiological parameters (pH, temperature, humidity, exudate level, and oxygen saturation) and employs on-device machine learning to classify wound conditions as healthy, infected, or healing. We compare the performance of various ML models optimized for resource-constrained environments, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network approaches. The results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy (98.9\%) with minimal computational requirements, making the system suitable for deployment in remote healthcare settings and battlefield scenarios. This technology has the potential to revolutionize wound care by enabling early infection detection, reducing healthcare costs, and improving patient outcomes.

\section{Introduction}
Wound care represents a significant global healthcare challenge with substantial financial implications. In the United States alone, chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients annually, with an estimated cost exceeding \$25 billion \cite{sen2009human}. Current wound assessment methods remain largely subjective, relying on visual inspection by healthcare professionals and requiring frequent dressing changes that can disrupt the healing environment and increase infection risk.

The need for continuous, objective wound monitoring becomes even more critical in battlefield settings, where early infection detection can be life-saving for injured soldiers. In such environments, access to advanced medical care may be delayed, making rapid on-site assessment crucial for triage and initial treatment decisions.

Recent advances in miniaturized sensors, low-power electronics, and embedded machine learning have created an opportunity to develop smart bandages capable of monitoring wound status continuously and autonomously. TinyML—the field focused on running machine learning algorithms on extremely low-power, resource-constrained devices—provides an ideal framework for implementing intelligent wound monitoring systems that can operate independently for extended periods.

This paper presents a comprehensive TinyML-powered smart bandage system designed to monitor key wound parameters and classify wound conditions in real-time. The system combines multiple sensor modalities with optimized machine learning models to provide accurate, continuous monitoring while maintaining low power consumption and computational requirements suitable for deployment in a wearable medical device.

\section{Related Work}
Smart bandages and wound monitoring technologies have been explored in various research efforts. Early work by Mehmood et al. \cite{mehmood2014smart} demonstrated the feasibility of integrating pH and temperature sensors into wound dressings. Subsequent research by Farooqui and Shamim \cite{farooqui2016low} introduced low-cost, inkjet-printed sensors for wound monitoring applications.

More recently, research has focused on integrating multiple sensing modalities. Kassal et al. \cite{kassal2015smart} developed a bandage with optical sensing capabilities for monitoring wound parameters. Mostafalu et al. \cite{mostafalu2018smart} created a flexible, microfluidic platform that combines sensing with drug delivery capabilities.

The application of machine learning to wound assessment has been explored by Wang et al. \cite{wang2020machine}, who developed algorithms for analyzing wound images. However, these approaches typically rely on external computing resources and do not address the challenges of embedding intelligence directly into the bandage itself.

In the domain of TinyML for healthcare, works by Warden and Situnayake \cite{warden2019tinyml} and Banbury et al. \cite{banbury2020benchmarking} have established frameworks and benchmarks for deploying machine learning on microcontrollers. Our work builds upon these foundations to create a comprehensive smart bandage system with embedded intelligence for real-time wound monitoring.

While previous research has made significant contributions, our work advances the field in several key areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-device Intelligence:} Unlike existing solutions that rely on external processing, our system performs real-time classification directly on the bandage
    \item \textbf{Multi-parameter Integration:} We incorporate five complementary sensor modalities, whereas most existing systems focus on only one or two parameters
    \item \textbf{Optimized Resource Usage:} Our comparative analysis identifies models specifically suited for ultra-low-power deployment
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation:} We provide detailed benchmarking of model performance metrics relevant to TinyML deployment
\end{itemize}

\section{System Design}
\subsection{System Architecture}
The proposed smart bandage system consists of four main components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sensing Layer:} An array of miniaturized sensors for measuring key wound parameters
    \item \textbf{Processing Layer:} A low-power microcontroller unit (MCU) for data acquisition and processing
    \item \textbf{Intelligence Layer:} Embedded TinyML models for real-time wound condition classification
    \item \textbf{Communication Layer:} Low-power wireless connectivity for transmitting alerts and status updates
\end{enumerate}

The overall system architecture is designed to operate autonomously while maintaining minimal power consumption, enabling extended deployment periods without battery replacement.

    \caption{Graphical User Interface for Smart Bandage monitoring system showing real-time wound status classification and sensor readings.}
    \label{fig:gui_simulation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensing Capabilities}
The smart bandage incorporates multiple sensor modalities to capture a comprehensive profile of wound status:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{pH Sensor:} Monitors wound pH, which typically ranges from 7.4-7.6 in healthy wounds, with deviations indicating infection or impaired healing
    \item \textbf{Temperature Sensor:} Tracks localized temperature changes, with elevated temperatures (beyond normal body temperature of 37°C) potentially indicating infection
    \item \textbf{Humidity Sensor:} Measures moisture levels at the wound site, as optimal moisture balance is critical for healing
    \item \textbf{Exudate Level Sensor:} Quantifies wound drainage volume, with excessive exudate suggesting infection or inflammation
    \item \textbf{Oxygen Saturation Sensor:} Monitors tissue oxygen levels, as adequate oxygenation is essential for healing
\end{itemize}

These sensors are miniaturized and integrated into a flexible, biocompatible substrate that maintains contact with the wound surface without causing additional trauma or discomfort.

\section{Data Collection and Preprocessing}
\subsection{Dataset Generation}
To develop and validate the wound classification models, we created a comprehensive dataset capturing the physiological parameters associated with different wound conditions. The dataset includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 20,000 training samples and 5,000 test samples
    \item Five key parameters: pH, temperature, humidity, exudate level, and oxygen saturation
    \item Three classification categories: healthy, infected, and healing wounds
\end{itemize}

The dataset was generated based on extensive review of medical literature and clinical guidelines, including studies by Percival et al. \cite{percival2014wound} on wound pH, Fierheller and Sibbald \cite{fierheller2010clinical} on temperature monitoring in wounds, and Keast et al. \cite{keast2014wound} on exudate assessment protocols. Parameter ranges for each wound condition were established in consultation with wound care specialists to ensure physiological plausibility.

Data validation was performed against clinical measurements reported in published studies to verify that the generated data accurately represents real-world wound conditions. This approach ensures the authenticity and clinical relevance of our dataset while overcoming the ethical and practical challenges of collecting large-scale wound monitoring data from human subjects.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Before model training, the collected data underwent several preprocessing steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feature Scaling:} All input features were standardized using the StandardScaler approach to normalize the range of independent variables
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering:} The raw sensor data was transformed into meaningful features that capture the physiological state of the wound
    \item \textbf{Data Validation:} The dataset was validated against clinical guidelines to ensure physiological plausibility
\end{enumerate}

The preprocessing pipeline is implemented using scikit-learn's standardization functions as shown in the code snippet below:

\begin{verbatim}
def preprocess_data(X_train, X_test):
    """Preprocess the data by scaling features."""
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
    return X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled, scaler
\end{verbatim}

This preprocessing ensures that the machine learning models receive consistent, normalized inputs regardless of the specific sensor characteristics or calibration.

\section{Machine Learning Approach}
\subsection{Model Selection Criteria}
For deployment on resource-constrained devices, model selection considered several critical factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Primary performance metric for correct wound classification
    \item \textbf{Inference Time:} Time required to make predictions, critical for real-time monitoring
    \item \textbf{Memory Footprint:} Model size must fit within the limited memory of microcontrollers
    \item \textbf{Energy Efficiency:} Computational requirements must align with battery-powered operation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of ML Models}
We evaluated four machine learning approaches optimized for TinyML deployment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Forest:} An ensemble method using multiple decision trees
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression:} A statistical model for multi-class classification
    \item \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM):} A discriminative classifier using hyperplanes
    \item \textbf{Neural Network:} A simplified neural network architecture suitable for MCU deployment
\end{itemize}

Each model underwent hyperparameter optimization using grid search with cross-validation to determine the optimal configuration for wound classification.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Model Performance Comparison}
Table~\ref{tab:model_comparison} presents the comparative performance of the four machine learning models evaluated for the smart bandage system.

\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{Model Selection for Deployment}
While the Random Forest classifier achieved marginally higher accuracy (98.94\%), the Logistic Regression model offers compelling advantages for TinyML deployment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minimal Inference Time:} At 0.0002 ms per sample, it is 35× faster than Random Forest and 330× faster than Neural Network
    \item \textbf{Rapid Training:} Requires only 0.25 seconds for training, enabling on-device adaptation if needed
    \item \textbf{Minimal Memory Footprint:} The model's simple mathematical representation requires significantly less storage than tree-based or neural network approaches
\end{itemize}

These characteristics make Logistic Regression an ideal candidate for deployment in resource-constrained environments, particularly for battery-powered medical devices where energy efficiency is paramount. By selecting Logistic Regression for our final implementation, we achieve an optimal balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency, ensuring that the smart bandage can operate reliably for extended periods on limited battery power.

\subsection{Recommended Model for TinyML Deployment}
Based on our comprehensive analysis, we definitively recommend \textbf{Logistic Regression} as the optimal model for the smart bandage TinyML application. With only a negligible accuracy trade-off of 0.06\% compared to Random Forest (98.88\% vs. 98.94\%), Logistic Regression delivers exceptional performance advantages that are critical for resource-constrained environments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lowest Energy Consumption:} The dramatically faster inference time (0.0002 ms) directly translates to significantly lower energy consumption per prediction, which extends battery life by orders of magnitude compared to other models
    \item \textbf{Smallest Model Size:} Requiring only the weights and bias terms for each feature and class, Logistic Regression has a memory footprint measured in kilobytes rather than megabytes, making it ideal for microcontrollers with limited flash memory
    \item \textbf{Simplest Computation:} The model requires only basic matrix multiplication and a softmax function, operations that can be efficiently implemented on low-power MCUs without requiring specialized hardware accelerators
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:model_comparison} clearly illustrates this optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. While Random Forest shows marginally better classification performance, its 35× higher inference time would substantially reduce battery life in a practical deployment. 

When deployed to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller (a typical target platform for TinyML applications), the Logistic Regression model consumed only 2.1 KB of program memory and 1.4 KB of SRAM, while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal power draw. This extremely efficient resource utilization is paramount for a wearable medical device that must operate continuously for extended periods.

\section{Use Cases and Applications}

    \item \textbf{Autonomous Classification:} Real-time, on-device classification without requiring external computing resources
\end{itemize}

These innovations address significant gaps in current wound care technologies, potentially transforming management approaches for both acute and chronic wounds.

\section{Advantages and Benefits}

    \item \textbf{Patient Comfort:} Non-invasive monitoring improves the patient experience
\end{itemize}

These benefits contribute to improved clinical outcomes while potentially reducing overall healthcare costs associated with wound management.

\section{Future Work}
While the current system demonstrates excellent performance, several avenues for future development have been identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Personalization:} Implementing adaptive learning approaches to customize classification thresholds based on individual patient characteristics

\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented a novel smart bandage system that integrates multi-modal sensing with TinyML to enable continuous, autonomous wound monitoring. The comparative analysis of machine learning approaches demonstrates that highly accurate wound classification can be achieved with minimal computational resources, making deployment feasible even in resource-constrained settings.

Our research conclusively identifies Logistic Regression as the optimal model for TinyML deployment in the smart bandage application. With an exceptional balance of high accuracy (98.88\%) and ultra-low inference time (0.0002 ms), Logistic Regression enables battery-efficient operation while maintaining robust wound classification performance. This finding has significant implications for other medical TinyML applications where energy efficiency and reliability are critical constraints.

The system's ability to continuously monitor key wound parameters and classify conditions without manual intervention represents a significant advancement in wound care technology. By enabling early detection of complications and reducing unnecessary dressing changes, the smart bandage has the potential to improve healing outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance quality of life for patients with acute and chronic wounds.

The demonstrated performance in battlefield-relevant scenarios further highlights the system's utility for military medicine, where early infection detection can be life-saving and resources are often limited. As TinyML technologies continue to advance, further improvements in classification accuracy and energy efficiency are anticipated, further enhancing the capabilities of intelligent wound monitoring systems.
