## 3. Feature Comparison

### 3.1 Parameter Selection

Our approach uses a comprehensive set of five key parameters that together provide a holistic view of wound status. Compared to:
- Rahimi et al.: Similar core parameters but lacks exudate quantification
- Faroqi et al.: More specialized in bacterial detection but fewer general healing parameters
- Mehmood et al.: Similar range but more dependent on visual assessment

### 3.2 Classification Approach

Our three-state classification offers a balance between:
- Rahimi's binary approach (simpler but less informative)
- Mehmood's four-state approach (more granular but potentially more prone to classification errors)

### 3.3 Data Handling

Our synthetic dataset approach offers:
- Much larger sample size (25,000 vs. hundreds in other studies)
- Carefully modeled parameter distributions based on medical literature
- Realistic parameter correlations reflecting actual wound physiology
- Balanced class distribution for robust model training

### 3.4 Model Selection and Training

Our Random Forest approach with extensive hyperparameter tuning offers:
- Better explainability than neural networks (Faroqi et al.)
- More sophisticated modeling than basic SVM (Rahimi et al.)
- More streamlined implementation than ensemble approaches (Mehmood et al.)
- Higher reported accuracy (95-98% vs. 89-93.5%)

## 4. Performance Comparison

### 4.1 Classification Accuracy

## 5. Future Integration Opportunities

Based on this comparative analysis, our approach could be enhanced by integrating:

1. **Hardware Integration** (from Rahimi): Implementing our model on actual wireless bandage hardware
2. **Bacterial Specificity** (from Faroqi): Adding specific bacterial metabolite detection
3. **Temporal Analysis** (from Mehmood): Incorporating time-series data of wound healing progression
4. **Image Processing**: Adding wound image analysis to complement sensor data
5. **Clinical Validation**: Testing with real patient data to validate the synthetic data approach

## 6. Conclusion

Our Smart Bandage ML model represents a balanced approach with strengths in dataset size, parameter correlation modeling, and classification accuracy. While other approaches offer advantages in hardware integration, bacterial specificity, or temporal analysis, our model provides a robust foundation that could be enhanced by incorporating these elements in future iterations.

The synthetic data approach allows for extensive model training and validation before hardware implementation, potentially accelerating development cycles and improving final classification performance compared to approaches limited by small clinical datasets.
